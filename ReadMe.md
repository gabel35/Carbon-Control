## APIs
### Cool Climate Calculator API
https://coolclimate.org/api 

### Air Quality API
https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
determine the types of code to be used (Jquery, CSS frameworks)
what parameters we want the application to focus on/get from the user
determine all the features (storing user input with their login credentials, challenge of the day, etc.)
research the functionality and limits of the APIs
find other userful APIs based on features of the application (NY Times?)
Finalize the wireframe
